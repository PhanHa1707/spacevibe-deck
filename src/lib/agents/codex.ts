 * Codex 0.154's TUI animates while idle: a startup spinner and a starfield
 * behind the composer, repainted ~12 times a second for as long as the pane
 * sits at its prompt (measured 2026-09-18, DECK-121). Deck's sustained-output
 * heuristic cannot tell that from a working agent, so every Codex row showed
 * the busy bars before the first prompt and kept them after the last reply.
 * `tui.animations=false` is Codex's own switch for it; with it the pane goes
 * silent 2.6 s after launch and stays silent at the prompt. Carried on every
 * command Deck types, resume included, so a restored pane behaves the same.
 * A user-written launch command does not inherit it — the `quiet` control
 * below and `docs/user/agents.md` say what to add.
